# Can anyone please help me?

why doesn't microsoft let you rebind your Surface Slim Pen 2 buttons??? please????

They *do* however let you map the back button to "Run a program" (any `.exe` executable file), so I'm trying to have it so that it runs a program that just sends the ctrl + z input, BUT it doesn't really work because when the program opens, the active window switches from my drawing program to the `undo.exe` program that I just wrote because I don't know how to make it run in the background can anyone please help thank you ðŸ¥º
